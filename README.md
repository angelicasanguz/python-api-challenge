# python-api-challenge
# Your analysis of the data will be split into three main parts, or stages.
  1. Collect the Data 
  2. Exploratory Analysis with Visualization
  3. Visualize Travel Data
   You'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code.
    Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
    
      Latitude vs. Temperature

      Latitude vs. Humidity

      Latitude vs. Cloudiness

      Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. You may find it helpful to define a function in order to create the linear regression plots.
Next, create a series of scatter plots. Be sure to include the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r values as you can see in the following image.

Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
Create a new DataFrame from a new API search with new weather parameters.
Filter DataFrames based on input and nested decision statements, and logical expressions.
